# DevEvents - NextJS16

A full-stack web application built while following the **Next.js 16 Full Course** by **JavaScript Mastery**.  
The codebase is **not fully identical** to the course implementation, as I made several adjustments and improvements based on my own preferences and understanding.  
For example, image uploads are handled **directly on the server** instead of using third-party services.
